# TorrentVideo

## Get up and running

  * Clone the repo
  * Run ` npm install `
  * Run ` gulp `

  You should be all good at this point. You got your nodemon watching your app.js server script and browsersync watching the build/ folder, so you
  got hot reload everywhere.


#### In order for it to run you also need [AutonomousDownloader](https://github.com/RaulTsc/AutonomousTorrentDownloading) to run on port 3000.
#### A way to control that node instance would be implemented in the future
